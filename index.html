                    <li>Men have been wearing shorts for decades, but women were only allowed to wear them in public after World War II. One of the main reasons for this was because less fabric was available during the war, so shorts were more cost-effective than pants or skirts.</li>
                    <li>Harry Winston was the designer of the most expensive shoes in the world. The red ruby slippers he designed sold for $3 million.</li>
